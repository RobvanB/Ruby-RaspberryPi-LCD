Ruby-RaspberryPi-LCD
====================

Ruby Class that writes to a 16x2 LCD connected to a RaspberryPi.

The class uses the WiringPi library for the GPIO
See here; http://www.gadgetoid.com/2012/05/15/raspberry-pi-an-out-of-box-education-with-ruby/

Note that I used the 'manual' install of wiringPi as listed in the article.
I did not use the Gem.

See the bottom of class ruby-lcd.rb for examples.
